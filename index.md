## About Me

I am a third-year PhD student at LMU Munich (University of Munich) and Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Hinrich Schütze, Prof. Dr. Heike Adel, Prof. Dr. Jannik Strötgen and Dr. Lukas Lange. My research interests include **Multilingual large language models**; **Large language model interpretability**; **Language Model continual learning**.

Before starting my PhD, I obtained my master’s degree in Robotics, Cognition, and Intelligence (RCI) at Technical University of Munich (TUM) with high distinction, and my bachelor’s degree in Vehicle Engineering at Tongji University, Shanghai, as an outstanding graduate student.

## Research Interests

- Multilingual Large Language Models
- Large Language Model Interpretability
- Language Model Continual Learning
