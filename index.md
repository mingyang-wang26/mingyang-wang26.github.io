## About Me

I am a second-year PhD student at LMU Munich (University of Munich) and Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Hinrich Schütze, Prof. Dr. Heike Adel, Prof. Dr. Jannik Strötgen and Dr. Lukas Lange. My research interests include multilingual and low-resource natural language processing, and continual learning for natural language processing.

Before starting my PhD, I obtained my master’s degree in Robotics, Cognition, and Intelligence (RCI) at Technical University of Munich (TUM) with high distinction, and my bachelor’s degree in Vehicle Engineering at Tongji University, Shanghai, as an outstanding graduate student.

## Research Interests

- Low Resource and Multilingual NLP
- Continual Learning for NLP
- Parameter-Efficient Tuning of Language Models
- Large Language Models
